For some people telling your current supervisor that you have a history of bi-polar disorder might be easier than telling a potential employer that you have a history of compulsive gambling.

insofar as how I can use my depression to raise awareness or help others. Because of that my employer - or any future employer - kind of knows by default. It's not a secret. That said the downside of that openness is that I have no faith that I wouldn't be discriminated against at a future job simply because the information is public. Likewise I worry I'm seen as less-than by my employer in some circumstances. Regerdless I don't regret being public and raising awareness. My point is that even those of us who do publicly discuss the issue fear systemic retribution. \\n2014-08-28 16:55:07 | 35 | Male | United States | CA | No | No | No | Sometimes | More than 1000 | No | Yes | Don't know | Not sure | Yes | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Maybe | No | Some of them | No | No | No | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 16:55:31 | 33\", \"| male | United States | TN | No | Yes | No | NA | 26-100 | No | No | Yes | No | No | No | Yes | Somewhat difficult | No | No | Some of them | Some of them | No | No | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 16:56:26 | 37 | Male | Italy | NA | No | No | No | Sometimes | 26-100 | No | Yes | Don't know | Not sure | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Yes | Yes | Some of them | No | No | No | No | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 16:56:57 | 34 | M | United States | TN | No | No | Yes | Sometimes | 100-500 | No | Yes | Don't know | No | Yes | Don't know | Yes | Don't know | Maybe | No | Some of them | No | No | No | Don't know | No | At a previous employer I witness a bad thing happen to a coworker with mental health issues get swept under the rug... :(\\n2014-08-28 16:56:58 | 36 | Male | Netherlands | NA | Yes | No | Yes | Sometimes | 1-5 | No | Yes | No | No | No | No | Don't know | Very easy | No | No | Yes | No | No | No | Yes | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 16:57:07 | 40 | m | United States | TN | Yes | Yes | Yes | Sometimes | 1-5 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | Yes | Very easy | No | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 16:57:46 | 40 | M | United States | IL | No | No | No | Rarely | More than 1000 | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Don't know | No | No | Some of them | Some of them | No | Maybe | Don't know | No | While not personally affected I do have immediate family with mental health illness and my employer has been very supportive.

Now that we've grown things are better but I feel that overall our total benefits package (including healthcare) isn't well communicated. This reflects negatively on the mental health questions above but would also reflect negatively on any other sort of survey about the benefits. That is I don't think the company is purposefully doing less for mental health. They just aren't doing enough across the board and that includes mental health.\\n2014-08-28 17:02:56 | 32 | male | United Kingdom | NA | No | Yes | Yes | Rarely | 6-25 | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | Don't know | Yes | Maybe | Some of them | No | No | No | No | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:02:44 | 32 | male | United Kingdom | NA | No | Yes | Yes | Rarely | 6-25 | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | Don't know | Yes | Maybe | Some of them | No | No | No | No | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:03:42 | 26 | Male | United Kingdom | NA | Yes | No | Yes | Rarely | 1-5 | Yes | Yes | No | Not sure | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Somewhat difficult | No | No | Yes | Yes | Maybe | Maybe | Yes | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:07\", \":11 | 23 | M | United States | IL | No | No | No | Never | 100-500 | No | No | Don't know | No | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Maybe | No | Some of them | Some of them | Maybe | Maybe | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:07:28 | 33 | Male | United States | TN | No | Yes | Yes | Often | 6-25 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | Don't know | Very difficult | Yes | No | Some of them | Yes | No | Maybe | No | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:07:39 | 46 | Male | United States | IL | No | No | Yes | Rarely | More than 1000 | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Somewhat easy | Yes | Maybe | No | No | No | Maybe | Yes | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:08:16 | 34 | male | United Kingdom | NA | No | No | No | NA | 6-25 | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | No | Somewhat difficult | Yes | Maybe | No | No | No | Yes | No | Yes | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:09:03 | 35 | M | United States | DC | No | Yes | Yes | Sometimes | 6-25 | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Don't know | Somewhat easy | Maybe | Maybe | Some of them | Some of them | No | No | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:10:00 | 39 | M | United States | KS | No | No | No | NA | 1-5 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | Don't know | Very difficult | Maybe | Maybe | Some of them | Yes | Maybe | Maybe | No | No | Thank you for all you are doing to study this topic and raise awareness in our communities. \\n2014-08-28 17:10:04 | 32 | male | Germany | NA | Yes | No | No | Sometimes | 1-5 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |\", \"No | No | Yes | Somewhat easy | No | No | Some of them | Some of them | Maybe | Maybe | No | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:10:08 | 43 | Male | Mexico | NA | Yes | No | No | NA | More than 1000 | Yes | Yes | Don't know | No | No | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | No | No | Some of them | Yes | No | Maybe | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:11:48 | 56 | m | United States | CA | No | No | Yes | Rarely | More than 1000 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Don't know | Yes | Yes | Somewhat easy | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:12:30 | 32 | Female | United Kingdom | NA | No | Yes | Yes | Sometimes | 100-500 | No | Yes | Don't know | No | No | No | Don't know | Somewhat difficult | Maybe | No | Some of them | Some of them | No | Yes | Don't know | Yes | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:14:31 | 41 | male | United Kingdom | NA | No | No | No | NA | 26-100 | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Don't know | Maybe | Maybe | Some of them | Some of them | No | Yes | No | Yes | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:16:53 | 39 | Male | United States | TN | No | No | No | NA | More than 1000 | Yes | Yes | Don't know | Not sure | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | No | No | Some of them | Yes | No | No | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:19:05 | 37 | Male | United States | OK | No | Yes | No | NA | 500-1000 | No | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes | Very easy | Maybe | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | NA\\n2014-08-28\", \"17:19:27 | 30 | m | United States | CA | Yes | Yes | Yes | Sometimes | 6-25 | Yes | Yes | Don't know | Not sure | No | Don't know | Don't know | Very difficult | Yes | No | No | No | No | Maybe | Don't know | No | The main reason for the openness answers are because of an experience with my last employer. I felt I could trust my direct supervisor so I divulged information. It ended up spreading to more supervisors and eventually my coworkers. Supers highly suggested treatment but rushed things that shouldn't have been rushed and I ended up being incorrectly treated in a psych ward and mentally scarred from the issue.

Growing up in a family open about mental health and also at the end of my rope I immediately shared with management what was going on. I requested a temporary reduced workload so I could reduce anxiety. (At time I didn't know it was anxiety as took me a year to accept that the (to me) deserved stress was anxiety caused by my core diagnosis.) When disclosing I didn't deeply understand\", \"details of the state of my mental health; I simply knew I was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that I couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.It was at this point my direct manager and I began an almost daily struggle. After working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad I was doing) I requested increasing my workload. This was never granted; boss said I hadn't proved myself and implied I could not be trusted.Two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:1) Company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. They did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. They did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. They most certainly would not truly understand why to this day four years later despite being stable I'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. Rather than supporting that it would be seen as oh I'm sorry. I was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.2) Accomodations.- There was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). Instead they pushed me to take disability leave. I told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. That required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily as psychologist said I didn't qualify for leave. (Expensive unnecessary appointment).- The assistance I needed the most at work was understanding: I was open but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. That was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. He knew something was up but was barred from asking and I was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.- Accommodations weren't understood by even Benefits as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. Should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. When in a meeting with my manager supervised by HR I shouldn't feel like I'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether I'm doing anything right. That this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and putting on my dick hat to yell at me for something that wasn't\", \"even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling and turned to finish yelling at this person): FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.While I will never return to that company and as such took the severance package I will NEVER agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being medically disqualified from this role. I was too expensive in the short term for them; I'm not worth the cost.\\n2014-08-29 14:59:43 | 37 | female | United States | NJ | No | Yes | Yes | Sometimes | 26-100 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Yes | Maybe | No | No | No | Maybe | Don't know | No | If a man in tech is afraid of speaking up about these things it is even worse for women in tech who are already fearful of and fighting against the stigma of incompetence.  On the other hand if a female in tech does not commiserate with her male coworkers on mental health problems she will no longer be seen as a team player.

I worked too much had too much\", \"pressure on myself from being the sole developer on a delayed project that seemed to grow in size with each week it was delayed by and worried about money a lot.I became depressed and anxious and had trouble eating sleeping and generally being myself. As my depression worsened I was regularly late for work couldn't perform as well as I should and became irritable with my colleagues.My employers response after a while was to send me private messages complaining about my lateness which only worsened the situation. I was prescribed 3 weeks off work by my doctor which my employer agreed to only to come back after to find I had been on 'statutory pay' which was roughly half of what I was expecting and was not enough to cover my rent bills AND food. This made me worse and sent me into another depression until I eventually admitted defeat gave up working and left the company. It took me months to recover and I'm now left (over 6 months after this all started) recovering from the fallout I created leaving employment with hardly any money to my name.I had previously been told by my employer that I was too young to burn out and (stupidly) trusted them. I did not feel comfortable discussing my problems with my employer because each time I was met with an attitude that I had to get myself together and ultimately given the amount of employees before me who had left the company by being fired after an altercation with the employer left me with no option but to hide it from them so I too wouldn't be fired.\\n2014-09-14 09:04:08 | 20 | Male | Georgia | NA | No | No | No | Rarely | 26-100 | No | No | No | No | No | No | Don't know | Very difficult | Yes | Yes | Some of them | No | No | Maybe | No | No | NA\\n2014-09-14 20:50:05 | 38 | male | United States | NY | No | Yes | No | NA | 6-25 | No | Yes | Don't know | No | No | No | Don't know | Somewhat difficult | No | No | Some of them | Yes | No | No | Don't know | Yes | NA\\n2014-09-20 13:51:05 | 26 | Female | United States | MI | No | Yes | Yes | Rarely | 100-500 | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | Don't know | Don't\", \"know | Maybe | Maybe | No | No | No | Maybe | No | No | NA\\n2014-09-23 20:05:05 | 29 | Male | United States | OH | No | No | No | Never | 26-100 | No | Yes | No | No | No | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | No | No | Some of them | Yes | No | Yes | No | Yes | NA\\n2014-09-26 08:45:56 | 40 | m | China | NA | Yes | No | No | Sometimes | 1-5 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | Don't know | Somewhat easy | No | No | Some of them | Some of them | Maybe | Maybe | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-09-26 10:05:55 | 25 | female | Bulgaria | UT | No | No | Yes | Sometimes | 26-100 | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | Don't know | Don't know | Maybe | Maybe | Yes | Some of them | Maybe | No | No | No | NA\\n2014-09-26 21:25:14 | 32 | Woman | United States | NY | No | No | Yes | Sometimes | 26-100 | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes | Don't know | Maybe | Maybe | Some of them | No | No | No | No | No | NA\\n2014-09-30 09:19:01 | 38 | male | United States | CA | No | Yes | Yes | Sometimes | More than 1000 | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Don't know | Maybe | No | Some of them | No | No | Maybe | No | Yes | NA\\n2014-10-02 21:25:16 | 72 | Female | United States | IN | No | Yes | Yes | Never | 500-1000 | Yes | No | Yes | Not sure | Don't know | Yes | Don't know | Somewhat easy | Maybe | Maybe | Some of them | Yes | No | No | Don't know | Yes | NA\\n2014-10-05 21:16:10 | 35 | female | United States | IN | No | Yes | Yes |\", \"Sometimes | 1-5 | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | Yes | Don't know | Maybe | Maybe | Some of them | Some of them | No | No | Yes | No | NA\\n2014-10-09 11:14:59 | 28 | F | United States | VA | No | No | Yes | Often | 6-25 | No | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | Don't know | Very difficult | Yes | Maybe | Some of them | Some of them | No | No | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-11-05 10:08:44 | 27 | femail | United States | OK | No | No | No | Never | 100-500 | No | No | Don't know | Not sure | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | No | No | Some of them | Yes | No | No | Yes | No | NA\\n2014-11-06 11:24:38 | 56 | female | United States | OR | Yes | No | No | Rarely | 1-5 | Yes | Yes | Don't know | Not sure | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Maybe | Maybe | No | No | No | No | Don't know | No | I'm self-employed on contract with small start-up.

I haven't seen many in our community discussing trauma-related mental health issues but they are just as real and just as debilitating.\\n2015-02-21 04:16:05 | 34 | Male | Canada | NA | No | Yes | No

insofar as how I can use my depression to raise awareness or help others. Because of that my employer - or any future employer - kind of knows by default. It's not a secret. That said the downside of that openness is that I have no faith that I wouldn't be discriminated against at a future job simply because the information is public. Likewise I worry I'm seen as less-than by my employer in some circumstances. Regerdless I don't regret being public and raising awareness. My point is that even those of us who do publicly discuss the issue fear systemic retribution. \\n2014-08-28 16:55:07 | 35 | Male | United States | CA | No | No | No | Sometimes | More than 1000 | No | Yes | Don't know | Not sure | Yes | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Maybe | No | Some of them | No | No | No | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 16:55:31 | 33\", \"| male | United States | TN | No | Yes | No | NA | 26-100 | No | No | Yes | No | No | No | Yes | Somewhat difficult | No | No | Some of them | Some of them | No | No | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 16:56:26 | 37 | Male | Italy | NA | No | No | No | Sometimes | 26-100 | No | Yes | Don't know | Not sure | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Yes | Yes | Some of them | No | No | No | No | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 16:56:57 | 34 | M | United States | TN | No | No | Yes | Sometimes | 100-500 | No | Yes | Don't know | No | Yes | Don't know | Yes | Don't know | Maybe | No | Some of them | No | No | No | Don't know | No | At a previous employer I witness a bad thing happen to a coworker with mental health issues get swept under the rug... :(\\n2014-08-28 16:56:58 | 36 | Male | Netherlands | NA | Yes | No | Yes | Sometimes | 1-5 | No | Yes | No | No | No | No | Don't know | Very easy | No | No | Yes | No | No | No | Yes | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 16:57:07 | 40 | m | United States | TN | Yes | Yes | Yes | Sometimes | 1-5 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | Yes | Very easy | No | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 16:57:46 | 40 | M | United States | IL | No | No | No | Rarely | More than 1000 | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Don't know | No | No | Some of them | Some of them | No | Maybe | Don't know | No | While not personally affected I do have immediate family with mental health illness and my employer has been very supportive.

Now that we've grown things are better but I feel that overall our total benefits package (including healthcare) isn't well communicated. This reflects negatively on the mental health questions above but would also reflect negatively on any other sort of survey about the benefits. That is I don't think the company is purposefully doing less for mental health. They just aren't doing enough across the board and that includes mental health.\\n2014-08-28 17:02:56 | 32 | male | United Kingdom | NA | No | Yes | Yes | Rarely | 6-25 | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | Don't know | Yes | Maybe | Some of them | No | No | No | No | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:02:44 | 32 | male | United Kingdom | NA | No | Yes | Yes | Rarely | 6-25 | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | Don't know | Yes | Maybe | Some of them | No | No | No | No | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:03:42 | 26 | Male | United Kingdom | NA | Yes | No | Yes | Rarely | 1-5 | Yes | Yes | No | Not sure | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Somewhat difficult | No | No | Yes | Yes | Maybe | Maybe | Yes | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:07\", \":11 | 23 | M | United States | IL | No | No | No | Never | 100-500 | No | No | Don't know | No | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Maybe | No | Some of them | Some of them | Maybe | Maybe | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:07:28 | 33 | Male | United States | TN | No | Yes | Yes | Often | 6-25 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | Don't know | Very difficult | Yes | No | Some of them | Yes | No | Maybe | No | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:07:39 | 46 | Male | United States | IL | No | No | Yes | Rarely | More than 1000 | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Somewhat easy | Yes | Maybe | No | No | No | Maybe | Yes | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:08:16 | 34 | male | United Kingdom | NA | No | No | No | NA | 6-25 | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | No | Somewhat difficult | Yes | Maybe | No | No | No | Yes | No | Yes | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:09:03 | 35 | M | United States | DC | No | Yes | Yes | Sometimes | 6-25 | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Don't know | Somewhat easy | Maybe | Maybe | Some of them | Some of them | No | No | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:10:00 | 39 | M | United States | KS | No | No | No | NA | 1-5 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | Don't know | Very difficult | Maybe | Maybe | Some of them | Yes | Maybe | Maybe | No | No | Thank you for all you are doing to study this topic and raise awareness in our communities. \\n2014-08-28 17:10:04 | 32 | male | Germany | NA | Yes | No | No | Sometimes | 1-5 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |\", \"No | No | Yes | Somewhat easy | No | No | Some of them | Some of them | Maybe | Maybe | No | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:10:08 | 43 | Male | Mexico | NA | Yes | No | No | NA | More than 1000 | Yes | Yes | Don't know | No | No | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | No | No | Some of them | Yes | No | Maybe | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:11:48 | 56 | m | United States | CA | No | No | Yes | Rarely | More than 1000 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Don't know | Yes | Yes | Somewhat easy | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:12:30 | 32 | Female | United Kingdom | NA | No | Yes | Yes | Sometimes | 100-500 | No | Yes | Don't know | No | No | No | Don't know | Somewhat difficult | Maybe | No | Some of them | Some of them | No | Yes | Don't know | Yes | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:14:31 | 41 | male | United Kingdom | NA | No | No | No | NA | 26-100 | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Don't know | Maybe | Maybe | Some of them | Some of them | No | Yes | No | Yes | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:16:53 | 39 | Male | United States | TN | No | No | No | NA | More than 1000 | Yes | Yes | Don't know | Not sure | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | No | No | Some of them | Yes | No | No | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-08-28 17:19:05 | 37 | Male | United States | OK | No | Yes | No | NA | 500-1000 | No | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes | Very easy | Maybe | No | No | No | No | No | No | No | NA\\n2014-08-28\", \"17:19:27 | 30 | m | United States | CA | Yes | Yes | Yes | Sometimes | 6-25 | Yes | Yes | Don't know | Not sure | No | Don't know | Don't know | Very difficult | Yes | No | No | No | No | Maybe | Don't know | No | The main reason for the openness answers are because of an experience with my last employer. I felt I could trust my direct supervisor so I divulged information. It ended up spreading to more supervisors and eventually my coworkers. Supers highly suggested treatment but rushed things that shouldn't have been rushed and I ended up being incorrectly treated in a psych ward and mentally scarred from the issue.

Growing up in a family open about mental health and also at the end of my rope I immediately shared with management what was going on. I requested a temporary reduced workload so I could reduce anxiety. (At time I didn't know it was anxiety as took me a year to accept that the (to me) deserved stress was anxiety caused by my core diagnosis.) When disclosing I didn't deeply understand\", \"details of the state of my mental health; I simply knew I was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that I couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.It was at this point my direct manager and I began an almost daily struggle. After working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad I was doing) I requested increasing my workload. This was never granted; boss said I hadn't proved myself and implied I could not be trusted.Two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:1) Company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. They did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. They did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. They most certainly would not truly understand why to this day four years later despite being stable I'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. Rather than supporting that it would be seen as oh I'm sorry. I was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.2) Accomodations.- There was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). Instead they pushed me to take disability leave. I told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. That required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily as psychologist said I didn't qualify for leave. (Expensive unnecessary appointment).- The assistance I needed the most at work was understanding: I was open but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. That was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. He knew something was up but was barred from asking and I was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.- Accommodations weren't understood by even Benefits as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. Should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. When in a meeting with my manager supervised by HR I shouldn't feel like I'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether I'm doing anything right. That this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and putting on my dick hat to yell at me for something that wasn't\", \"even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling and turned to finish yelling at this person): FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.While I will never return to that company and as such took the severance package I will NEVER agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being medically disqualified from this role. I was too expensive in the short term for them; I'm not worth the cost.\\n2014-08-29 14:59:43 | 37 | female | United States | NJ | No | Yes | Yes | Sometimes | 26-100 | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Yes | Maybe | No | No | No | Maybe | Don't know | No | If a man in tech is afraid of speaking up about these things it is even worse for women in tech who are already fearful of and fighting against the stigma of incompetence.  On the other hand if a female in tech does not commiserate with her male coworkers on mental health problems she will no longer be seen as a team player.

I worked too much had too much\", \"pressure on myself from being the sole developer on a delayed project that seemed to grow in size with each week it was delayed by and worried about money a lot.I became depressed and anxious and had trouble eating sleeping and generally being myself. As my depression worsened I was regularly late for work couldn't perform as well as I should and became irritable with my colleagues.My employers response after a while was to send me private messages complaining about my lateness which only worsened the situation. I was prescribed 3 weeks off work by my doctor which my employer agreed to only to come back after to find I had been on 'statutory pay' which was roughly half of what I was expecting and was not enough to cover my rent bills AND food. This made me worse and sent me into another depression until I eventually admitted defeat gave up working and left the company. It took me months to recover and I'm now left (over 6 months after this all started) recovering from the fallout I created leaving employment with hardly any money to my name.I had previously been told by my employer that I was too young to burn out and (stupidly) trusted them. I did not feel comfortable discussing my problems with my employer because each time I was met with an attitude that I had to get myself together and ultimately given the amount of employees before me who had left the company by being fired after an altercation with the employer left me with no option but to hide it from them so I too wouldn't be fired.\\n2014-09-14 09:04:08 | 20 | Male | Georgia | NA | No | No | No | Rarely | 26-100 | No | No | No | No | No | No | Don't know | Very difficult | Yes | Yes | Some of them | No | No | Maybe | No | No | NA\\n2014-09-14 20:50:05 | 38 | male | United States | NY | No | Yes | No | NA | 6-25 | No | Yes | Don't know | No | No | No | Don't know | Somewhat difficult | No | No | Some of them | Yes | No | No | Don't know | Yes | NA\\n2014-09-20 13:51:05 | 26 | Female | United States | MI | No | Yes | Yes | Rarely | 100-500 | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | Don't know | Don't\", \"know | Maybe | Maybe | No | No | No | Maybe | No | No | NA\\n2014-09-23 20:05:05 | 29 | Male | United States | OH | No | No | No | Never | 26-100 | No | Yes | No | No | No | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | No | No | Some of them | Yes | No | Yes | No | Yes | NA\\n2014-09-26 08:45:56 | 40 | m | China | NA | Yes | No | No | Sometimes | 1-5 | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | Don't know | Somewhat easy | No | No | Some of them | Some of them | Maybe | Maybe | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-09-26 10:05:55 | 25 | female | Bulgaria | UT | No | No | Yes | Sometimes | 26-100 | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | Don't know | Don't know | Maybe | Maybe | Yes | Some of them | Maybe | No | No | No | NA\\n2014-09-26 21:25:14 | 32 | Woman | United States | NY | No | No | Yes | Sometimes | 26-100 | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes | Don't know | Maybe | Maybe | Some of them | No | No | No | No | No | NA\\n2014-09-30 09:19:01 | 38 | male | United States | CA | No | Yes | Yes | Sometimes | More than 1000 | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Don't know | Maybe | No | Some of them | No | No | Maybe | No | Yes | NA\\n2014-10-02 21:25:16 | 72 | Female | United States | IN | No | Yes | Yes | Never | 500-1000 | Yes | No | Yes | Not sure | Don't know | Yes | Don't know | Somewhat easy | Maybe | Maybe | Some of them | Yes | No | No | Don't know | Yes | NA\\n2014-10-05 21:16:10 | 35 | female | United States | IN | No | Yes | Yes |\", \"Sometimes | 1-5 | Yes | Yes | No | No | No | No | Yes | Don't know | Maybe | Maybe | Some of them | Some of them | No | No | Yes | No | NA\\n2014-10-09 11:14:59 | 28 | F | United States | VA | No | No | Yes | Often | 6-25 | No | Yes | No | Yes | No | No | Don't know | Very difficult | Yes | Maybe | Some of them | Some of them | No | No | Don't know | No | NA\\n2014-11-05 10:08:44 | 27 | femail | United States | OK | No | No | No | Never | 100-500 | No | No | Don't know | Not sure | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | No | No | Some of them | Yes | No | No | Yes | No | NA\\n2014-11-06 11:24:38 | 56 | female | United States | OR | Yes | No | No | Rarely | 1-5 | Yes | Yes | Don't know | Not sure | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Don't know | Maybe | Maybe | No | No | No | No | Don't know | No | I'm self-employed on contract with small start-up.

I haven't seen many in our community discussing trauma-related mental health issues but they are just as real and just as debilitating.\\n2015-02-21 04:16:05 | 34 | Male | Canada | NA | No | Yes | No
